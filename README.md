# behavior_dashboard
a generalized dashboard for behavior management data collection.

This most recent overhaul for BISU takes a turn--prior, behavior data were collected per-student per-period 100% of the time. Now, behavior data are only collected for infractions and are used on a per-student basis to determine the number and level of infractions for future consequence determination. This version for now just logs infractions and returns a list by student. 

TODO: 
* figure out what R wants to do with uniform infractions
* deploy to shinyapps (naming conventions?)
* handle authentication issues for other users


Deep TODO: 
* visual analyses
* whole school analyses
* grade level analyses? 
* student level warning system (e.g. student is approaching major sanction soon)
* aesthetics okay?
