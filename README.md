# behavior_dashboard
a generalized dashboard for behavior management data collection.

Given that the reach of my behavior management point sheet program has tripled in the last year, can I create a behavior management dashboard R shiny app that incorporates all relevant use cases? 

Per TG's suggestion, can this be a side-hustle for a small amount of $ that can be used to afford a professional account at shinyapps.io, and can FCPS fund it for me????
